This is an attempt at porting what appears to be a lisp recovered from golden tapes found in the closet of an old BYU annex.

What follows is an attempt at deciphering what the symbols do. 

{L} = list
{K} = cons
{P} = lambda/procedure 
{D} = define
{S} = set!
{M} = macro
{E} = eq?
{B} = not
{A} = and
{O} = or
{I} = if
{T} = true
{F} = false

uppercase characters are reserved for functions and lowercase characters for variables in functions. 

There seems to be some notion of user worlds/levels in which different parts of the language are available. 

terrestial - you can call functions

telestial - you can define new functions and call them 

celestial - you can define what appear to be macros and even operators

The site has an online REPL where anyone is welcome to play with the environment. The users are - eve:rib adam:eve elohim:gonhorra

Respectively eve can access the terrestial, adam the telestial and elohim the celestial
